## 2.1 Making data findable, including provisions for metadata [FAIR data]

### Outline the discoverability of data (metadata provision)

  Present the discoverability of the data at ACTRIS data and services access unit (ACCESS) level.

### Outline the identifiability of data and refer to standard identification mechanism. Do you make use of persistent and unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers?

  Presetn the identification mechanisms for each individual data centre unit.

### Outline naming conventions used

  Present naming conventions at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

### Outline the approach towards search keyword

  Approach towards search keywords at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

### Outline the approach for clear versioning

  Question not answered.

### Specify standards for metadata creation (if any). If there are no standards in your discipline describe what metadata will be created and how

  Present standard(s) for metadata at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

## 2.2 Making data openly accessible [FAIR data]

### Specify which data will be made openly available? If some data is kept closed provide rationale for doing so

  Specify for each individual data centre unit.

### Specify how the data will be made available

  Specify for each individual data centre unit.

### Specify what methods or software tools are needed to access the data? Is documentation about the software needed to access the data included? Is it possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?

  Specify for each individual data centre unit and for the ACTRIS ACCESS unit.

### Specify where the data and associated metadata, documentation and code are deposited

  Question not answered.

### Specify how access will be provided in case there are any restrictions

  Question not answered.

## 2.3 Making data interoperable [FAIR data]

### Assess the interoperability of your data. Specify what data and metadata vocabularies, standards or methodologies you will follow to facilitate interoperability. 

  Question not answered.

### Specify whether you will be using standard vocabulary for all data types present in your data set, to allow inter-disciplinary interoperability? If not, will you provide mapping to more commonly used ontologies?

  Question not answered.

## 2.4 Increase data re-use (through clarifying licenses) [FAIR data]

### Specify how the data will be licenced to permit the widest reuse possible

  Question not answered.

### Specify when the data will be made available for re-use. If applicable, specify why and for what period a data embargo is needed 

  Question not answered.

### Specify whether the data produced and/or used in the project is useable by third parties, in particular after the end of the project? If the re-use of some data is restricted, explain why

  Question not answered.

### Describe data quality assurance processes

  Question not answered.

### Specify the length of time for which the data will remain re-usable

  Question not answered.

## 3. Allocation of resources

### Estimate the costs for making your data FAIR. Describe how you intend to cover these costs

  Question not answered.

### Clearly identify responsibilities for data management in your project

  Question not answered.

### Describe costs and potential value of long term preservation

  Question not answered.

## 4. Data security

### Address data recovery as well as secure storage and transfer of sensitive data 

  Question not answered.

## 5. Ethical aspects

### To be covered in the context of the ethics review, ethics section of DoA and ethics deliverables. Include references and related technical aspects if not covered by the former 

  Question not answered.

## 6. Other

### Refer to other national/funder/sectorial/departmental procedures for data management that you are using (if any) 

  Question not answered.
