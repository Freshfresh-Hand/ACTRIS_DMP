# ACTRIS Research Infrastructure initial outline of DMP

## Introduction to ACTRIS Data Centre

ACTRIS-2 (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure) Integrating Activity (IA) addresses
the scope of integrating state-of-the-art European ground-based stations for long-term observations of
aerosols, clouds and short lived gases. ACTRIS-2 is a unique research infrastructure improving the quality
of atmospheric observations, developing new methods and protocols, and harmonizing existing
observations of the atmospheric variables listed in Appendix I.

The overall goal of the ACTRIS Data Centre is to provide scientists and other user groups with free and
open access to all ACTRIS infrastructure data, complemented with access to innovative and mature data
products, together with tools for quality assurance (QA), data analysis and research following the [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).

The numerous measurement methodologies applied in ACTRIS result in a considerable diversity of the
data collected. In accordance with these requirements, the ACTRIS Data Centre currently consists of five topical
data repositories archiving the measurement data, which are all linked through the ACTRIS data portal to
provide a single access point to all data:

* ACTRIS In situ data centre unit (In-Situ): http://ebas.nilu.no/
* ACTRIS Aerosol remote sensing data centre unit (ARES): http://access.earlinet.org/EARLINET/
* ACTRIS Cloud remote sensing data centre unit (CLU): http://cloudnet.fmi.fi/
* ACTRIS trace gases remote sensing data centre unit (GRES): 
* ACTRIS Atmospheric simulation chamber data centre unit (ASC): https://data.eurochamp.org/

In addition, AERIS contributes with the production and provision of satellite data that complements the
ACTRIS ground-based data: http://www.icare.univ-lille1.fr/catalogue.

## 2.1 Making data findable, including provisions for metadata [FAIR data]

### Outline the discoverability of data (metadata provision)

  Present the discoverability of the data at ACTRIS data and services access unit (ACCESS) level.

### Outline the identifiability of data and refer to standard identification mechanism. Do you make use of persistent and unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers?

  Presetn the identification mechanisms for each individual data centre unit.

### Outline naming conventions used

  Present naming conventions at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

### Outline the approach towards search keyword

  Approach towards search keywords at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

### Outline the approach for clear versioning

  Question not answered.

### Specify standards for metadata creation (if any). If there are no standards in your discipline describe what metadata will be created and how

  Present standard(s) for metadata at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level.

## 2.2 Making data openly accessible [FAIR data]

### Specify which data will be made openly available? If some data is kept closed provide rationale for doing so

  Specify for each individual data centre unit.

### Specify how the data will be made available

  Specify for each individual data centre unit.

### Specify what methods or software tools are needed to access the data? Is documentation about the software needed to access the data included? Is it possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?

  Specify for each individual data centre unit and for the ACTRIS ACCESS unit.

### Specify where the data and associated metadata, documentation and code are deposited

  Question not answered.

### Specify how access will be provided in case there are any restrictions
